# data-structures
A repository of basic data structures in partnership with [Saki Fu](https://github.com/SakiFu).

Linked List - a singly linked list where the data is stored in nodes. The list has a pointer to the head, and each node keeps a pointer to the next node in sequence.

Stack - a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure similar to the linked list. Users can push a value onto the stack, and pop the top value off.
